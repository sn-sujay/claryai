# ClaryAI Project Progress Report

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation progress of the ClaryAI project according to the project documentation.

## Implementation Status

### Core API Implementation
- ✅ FastAPI application with all required endpoints
- ✅ Document parsing functionality
- ✅ API key validation
- ✅ Asynchronous processing for large files
- ✅ Zero data retention policy

### Docker Configuration
- ✅ Dockerfile for full image
- ✅ Dockerfile.slim for minimal image
- ✅ Docker images built successfully
- ✅ Docker containers running successfully

### Data Source Connectors
- ✅ File parsing (text, PDF, etc.)
- ✅ Web connector
- ✅ SQL connector
- ⚠️ Cloud storage connector (placeholder implemented)

### LLM Integration
- ✅ LLM configuration
- ✅ Query endpoint
- ✅ Schema generation endpoint
- ✅ Agent endpoint
- ✅ Three-way matching endpoint
- ⚠️ Phi-4-multimodal model integration (Partially Complete)
  - ✅ Modelfile created
  - ❌ Model file not included due to size constraints
  - ⚠️ Requires Ollama to be running

### Testing
- ✅ Test suite for all endpoints
- ✅ Manual testing of endpoints
- ⚠️ Integration tests (Partially Complete)

## Next Steps

### 1. Enhance Parsing Features
- [ ] Implement advanced table parsing with TableTransformer
- [ ] Test three-way matching with sample files
- [ ] Set up Redis for asynchronous processing

### 2. Improve LLM Integration
- [ ] Set up Ollama in the Docker container
- [ ] Add support for multiple LLM providers
- [ ] Implement caching for LLM responses

### 3. Finalize Documentation
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Create user guide
- [ ] Add examples for all endpoints

### 4. Deploy for Production
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Configure monitoring and logging
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Add security enhancements

## Issues and Challenges
- The full Docker image requires Ollama to be running for LLM functionality
- Integration tests are not yet complete
- Cloud storage connector is not fully implemented

## Conclusion
The ClaryAI project has made significant progress, with most of the core functionality implemented and working. The next steps focus on enhancing the parsing features, improving the LLM integration, finalizing the documentation, and preparing for production deployment.
