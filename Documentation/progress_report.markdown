# ClaryAI Project Progress Report

This document summarizes the progress made on the ClaryAI project, a self-hosted API for parsing documents of all file types into structured, LLM-ready JSON outputs with zero data retention.

## Project Overview

ClaryAI is a comprehensive document parsing solution that uses:
- **Unstructured.io** for document parsing
- **LlamaIndex** for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- **Optional Phi-4-multimodal** as an Agentic AI for autonomous text refinement, multimodal querying, and custom JSON schema generation

The API supports any LLM model via a generic interface, offline operation, dependency hiding via Cython, extensive data source connectors, zero data retention, three-way matching, advanced table parsing, chunking/deduplication, and asynchronous processing.

### Implementation Details

#### FastAPI Application

The core application in `src/main.py` includes:

1. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Optional LLM integration based on environment variables
   - Configurable model selection

2. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/parse` - Handles document parsing from various sources
   - `/query` - Enables querying parsed documents using LLM
   - `/generate_schema` - Generates custom JSON schemas
   - `/agent` - Performs agentic tasks on documents
   - `/match` - Implements three-way matching
   - `/status/{task_id}` - Checks status of asynchronous tasks

3. **Document Parsing**:
   - Supports multiple source types (file, SQL, API, web, cloud)
   - Implements chunking strategies (sentence, paragraph, fixed)
   - Ensures zero data retention by deleting temporary files

4. **LLM Integration**:
   - Supports any LLM model via langchain adapters
   - Pre-configured for Phi-4-multimodal
   - Fallback mechanisms for when LLM is not available

5. **Security Features**:
   - API key validation
   - Non-root user in Docker
   - Dependency hiding via Cython

#### Docker Configuration

1. **Full Image** (`Dockerfile`):
   - Includes all dependencies for full functionality
   - Supports LLM integration with Phi-4-multimodal
   - Includes Celery and Redis for asynchronous processing

2. **Slim Image** (`Dockerfile.slim`):
   - Minimal dependencies for core functionality
   - No LLM support
   - Smaller image size for resource-constrained environments

## Current Status

As of May 6, 2023, we have completed the following steps from the getting started guide:

1. ✅ **Step 1: Set Up Project Repository**
   - Created GitHub repository structure
   - Initialized with README.md
   - Set up Documentation directory

2. ✅ **Step 2: Implement FastAPI Application**

## Next Steps

According to the getting started guide, the immediate next steps are:

### 1. Build and Test Docker Images
- Build Docker images:
  ```bash
  docker build -t yourusername/claryai:latest -f Dockerfile .
  docker build -t yourusername/claryai:slim -f Dockerfile.slim .
  ```
- Run Docker containers:
  ```bash
  docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -e USE_LLM=false yourusername/claryai:slim
  docker run -d -p 8000:8000 -e USE_LLM=true -e LLM_MODEL=phi-4-multimodal yourusername/claryai:latest
  ```
- Push to Docker Hub (optional):
  ```bash
  docker push yourusername/claryai:latest
  docker push yourusername/claryai:slim
  ```

### 2. Test Data Source Connectors
- Test file parsing:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST -F "file=@sample.pdf" "http://localhost:8000/parse?api_key=123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
  ```
- Test SQL connector:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/parse?api_key=123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000&source_type=sql&source_url=sqlite:///test.db"
  ```
- Test web connector:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/parse?api_key=123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000&source_type=web&source_url=https://example.com"
  ```

### 3. Enhance Parsing Features

- Execute the test suite to verify all functionality

### 5. Finalize Documentation and Deploy
- Update documentation with any changes
- Deploy the API for production use

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenges Faced

1. **Repository Name Change**:
   - The repository was renamed from 'clary' to 'claryai'
   - Solution: Updated all references in the codebase to reflect the new name

2. **Docker Configuration**:
   - Needed to align Dockerfiles with the getting started guide
   - Solution: Restructured Dockerfiles to match the guide exactly

3. **Project Structure**:
   - Had to create a clean project structure from scratch
   - Solution: Followed the getting started guide to create the appropriate directory structure

4. **File Organization**:
   - Found duplicate directories and files (clary/ and sujay/ directories)
   - Solution: Cleaned up the repository structure to remove duplicates

## Conclusion

The ClaryAI project has made significant progress, with the core API implementation complete and Docker configuration in place. The next steps involve building and testing the Docker images, followed by testing the data source connectors and enhancing the parsing features.

The project is on track to deliver a robust, self-hosted API for parsing documents of all file types into structured, LLM-ready JSON outputs with zero data retention, as outlined in the project plan.
